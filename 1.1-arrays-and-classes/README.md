![lunar](lunar.jpg)

## Description

We spent time going over examples of when to use an array, a class, or a combination of both. For this assignment, come up with five of your own examples. It should be in the same format as in class: a short description followed by the code that represents it. You can use the JREPL to test your code. All examples should use a class.

## Example

```java
// A list of tweets.

class Tweet {
  String text;
  String username;
  int timestamp;
  boolean isPrivate;
}

Tweet[] tweets;
```
