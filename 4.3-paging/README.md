# Paging

## Description

Fork the [PeopleWeb](https://github.com/TIY-Charleston-Back-End-Oct2015/PeopleWeb) project. In this project, we're reading a CSV file full of data about people and parsing it into an `ArrayList<Person>`. Make the project use Spark to display this data in a large list. Once you are successfully displaying it, figure out how to make it show only 20 people at a time. You should provide a "Next" link at the bottom so the user can view the next 20 people in the list. It should be possible to cycle through all the users this way.

## Requirements

* Create a GET route for `/` and make a template for it that simply displays the name of each person in the `ArrayList<Person>`.
* Make it only display the first 20 names.
* Add a link to the bottom called "Next" which loads the same page but with a "page" parameter that causes it to load the *next* 20 names.
  * Note: You can pass parameters to GET routes by simply adding a question mark after it, like this: `/?page=2`.
* Create another GET route called `/person` which displays all the data about a single person.
  * It should take a GET parameter which is the index for that person in the `ArrayList<Person>`, like this: `/person?id=0`
* Make all the people shown on the main page link to their `/person` page, so I can click on their names for additional information.
* Optional: Make the main page and the person page display the data in an HTML table.
